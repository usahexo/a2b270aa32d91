#  Anguilla Gambler Hits Jackpot With J In Blackjack

A 43-year-old gambler from Anguilla hit the jackpot over the weekend, walking away with more than $250,000 after placing a single bet of $25 on a single hand of blackjack at the Starlight Casino in Windsor, Canada.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, told reporters that he had been planning to make the trip to Windsor for some time and decided to take the chance on blackjack after seeing what he thought was a favourable table.

"I could see that the dealer had a six showing and there were two cards left in the deck that were both worth 10 points," he said. "I just knew that I could get closer to 21 than the dealer could."

And that's exactly what happened - after the first two cards were dealt, the gambler saw that he had an ace and a nine, giving him a total of 20. The dealer then drew a three, giving her a total of 16. With only one card left to be drawn, the gambler opted to stand rather than risk going bust and watched as the dealer drew another card - essentially beating her with a final score of 21.

"I couldn't believe it when I won," he said. "It was my first time playing blackjack and I just got lucky."

While some may say that luck was certainly on his side, others might credit his winning streak to sound blackjack strategy. In any case, it goes to show that even inexperienced gamblers can walk away with big profits if they play smart and take advantage of favourable circumstances.
