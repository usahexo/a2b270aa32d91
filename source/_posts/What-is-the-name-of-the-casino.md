#  What is the maximum payout for a single bet?

When you are placing a bet, you may be wondering what the maximum payout is. This varies depending on the type of bet you are making, as well as the odds offered by the casino.

For most bets, the maximum payout is usually around ten or eleven times the amount wagered. So, if you bet $100 on a bet with a 10:1 payout, you could potentially win $1,000. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.

The biggest exception is when you place a bet on a single number in roulette. The maximum payout for this bet is 35:1, so if you bet $100 on a single number and it comes in, you would win $3,500.

Another exception is when playing craps and betting on the “hardways”. This particular bet has a payout of up to 12:1, meaning that if you wager $100 and hit one of these hardways bets, you could win up to $1,200.

So, while most bets have a payout of 10 or 11 to 1, there are some high paying exceptions that can result in some very big wins. Be sure to understand the different payouts before placing any bets though!
