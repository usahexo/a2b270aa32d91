#  Wagering Tables from Count Kustoms now at Las Vegas Casino

Las Vegas Casino is proud to announce the newest addition to our gaming floor, Wagering Tables from Count Kustoms. This unique and exciting game can be enjoyed by all players, regardless of experience or bankroll.

Wagering Tables is a casino game that simulates horseracing, using cards instead of horses. The object of the game is to correctly predict which numbered card will be drawn next from the deck, using either your own hand or information shared by other players at the table.

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, numbered 2 through Ace. After the first card is drawn, players can make one of three possible wagers: whether the next card will be higher than the first (called a “High” bet), lower than the first (a “Low” bet), or equal to the first (a “Match” bet).

After each subsequent card is drawn, players can either place new bets or adjust their existing ones. The amount wagered on any given bet depends on the point value of the two cards involved; for example, a High wager on a 6 and an 8 would be worth 4 points, while a Low wager on those same numbers would be worth 2 points.

At the end of the hand, whoever has wagered on the correct outcome collects points from all other players at the table. The player with the most points at the end of the hand is declared the winner!
