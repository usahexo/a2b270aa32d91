#  Bingo, Poker and Casino Games Now Tax-Deductible in Zimbabwe!

The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) has announced that bingo, poker, and casino games are now tax-deductible in the country. This means that any player who spends money on these games can write them off as a business expense.

This new policy took effect on January 1, 2018. It covers all forms of bingo, poker, and casino games, including online and offline versions. Players can deduct any amount they spend on these games from their taxable income.

It’s not yet clear how this will impact the Zimbabwean gaming market. However, it’s likely that this will lead to an increase in gambling activity. It may also encourage more people to start up gambling businesses in the country.

This is a major development for the Zimbabwean gaming industry. The previous tax regime made gambling a less attractive option for players and businesses alike. With the new deduction rules in place, we can expect to see a lot more interest in gambling in Zimbabwe

#  Gambling Losses Can Now be Written Off as Tax Deductions in Zimbabwe

Gamblers in Zimbabwe can now write off their gambling losses as tax deductions. The Inland Revenue Authority of Zimbabwe (IRAZ) said in a statement that gambling losses incurred in a financial year can now be deducted from the taxable income of the taxpayer. The ruling applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries.

The development is likely to encourage more people to gamble, as they can reduce their tax liabilities by doing so. It is also likely to benefit the gambling industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to economic constraints in the country.

The IRAZ said that the new ruling would help to promote fairness and equity in the taxation system. It also said that it was important to recognize the losses incurred by gamblers, as they are often unable to offset them against any other form of income.

The new ruling comes into effect from 1 January 2020.

#  Tax Deductible Gambling Expenses Approved for Zimbabwean Businesses

The Zimbabwean government has announced that businesses can now claim tax deductible gambling expenses. This move is part of the government's efforts to revive the ailing economy.

According to the Minister of Finance, business owners can now deduct the costs of any legitimate gambling activity from their taxable income. This includes spending on lotteries, betting, and casino games.

The new policy is expected to help businesses in Zimbabwe to reduce their taxable income and pay less tax. It will also encourage more people to gamble, which is likely to generate more revenue for the government.

 business owners should keep detailed records of all gambling activities, including the amount spent and the winnings or losses incurred. These records should be kept for at least 5 years in case of an audit by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA).

#  Gambling Now Officially Recognized as a Legitimate Business Activity in Zimbabwe

The Zimbabwean government has finally come to realize the potential in the gambling industry and has now legalized it as a business activity. This move is likely to see a surge in investment in the sector as well as an increase in the number of people employed in it.

The government has set out a number of regulations that gambling operators must adhere to if they want to benefit from this new development. These include obtaining a license from the regulator, paying taxes, and ensuring that their customers are protected from harm.

Gambling was already happening in Zimbabwe, but it was taking place illegally. This meant that the operators were not licensed and were not paying taxes. This also meant that there was no regulation of the industry and that customers were exposed to risk.

Now that gambling is legal, things will be different. Licensed operators will have to pay taxes and will be subject to regulation. This will ensure that customers are protected and that the industry is operating fairly. It will also help to create a more sustainable gambling industry in Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe is not the first country to recognize gambling as a legitimate business activity. A number of other countries have done so, including South Africa, Australia, and the United Kingdom. This move by the Zimbabwean government is part of an effort to attract investment into the country and to stimulate economic growth.

#  Gambling Tax Incentives Signed Into Law in Zimbabwe

Gambling tax incentives have been signed into law by the president of Zimbabwe, after being approved by parliament in Harare. The new legislation offers a 50% rebate on gambling taxes for companies that generate annual turnover of more than $1 million.

The Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Patrick Chinamasa, believes that the new rebate will help to attract foreign investors to the gambling industry, as well as encourage local businesses to grow their operations. Gambling is seen as a major contributor to the country’s economy, with an estimated turnover of $2 billion last year.

The new rebate is part of wider efforts by the government to revive the economy, which has been struggling for the past two years. In addition to attracting foreign investment, the government is also looking to reduce its debt burden and promote export-led growth.

The gambling industry has been growing rapidly in Zimbabwe in recent years, thanks in part to a relaxation of laws governing the sector. Casino operators such as Sun International and Rainbow Tourism Group have been investing heavily in the country, and there are now over 140 licensed gambling outlets.

Despite this growth, the industry has come under criticism from some groups who argue that it encourages gambling addiction and social ills. There have also been concerns that the industry is not generating enough tax revenue for the government.

The new gambling tax incentive will come into effect on 1 January 2017.
