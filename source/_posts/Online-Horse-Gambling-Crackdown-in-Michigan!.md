#  Online Horse Gambling Crackdown in Michigan!

The state of Michigan is in the process of cracking down on online horse gambling. This new crackdown, announced by the Michigan attorney general’s office on July 2, 2019, is part of a broader effort to target illegal gambling in the state.

Michigan residents are no longer able to gamble on horses through online platforms such as websites and apps. Violators could face misdemeanor charges and fines of up to $1,000.

“Online horse racing and wagering is illegal in Michigan,” said Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. “This crackdown is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Michigan consumers from illegal gambling activities.”

The announcement of the crackdown has drawn criticism from some people who argue that it makes it difficult for law-abiding citizens to place legitimate bets on horse races. However, officials say that they are simply enforcing existing laws, and that residents can still place bets at physical race tracks or through licensed online gambling platforms.

Illegal online horse betting is a problem nationwide, with estimates that it accounts for as much as $3 billion in wagers each year. In March 2019, federal authorities announced a crackdown on illegal horse betting operations, arresting dozens of people and seizing millions of dollars in assets.

#  Online Horse Gambling Banned in Iowa Again!

The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission has renewed its ban on online horse gambling, making it the second state to take such a step.

The unanimous vote by the commission on Wednesday means that Iowans will not be able to bet on races run anywhere in the world.

Commission chairman Jeff Lamberti said the panel made the decision after hearing from law enforcement and others that illegal gambling is flourishing in Iowa.

"It's clear that our prohibition on Internet wagering is not stopping Iowans from gambling on horses," Lamberti said. "In fact, it may be encouraging some to move away from regulated, taxed and safe gambling options to unlawful ones."

The anti-gambling sentiment in Iowa comes as no surprise; the state was one of the first to pass a law banning all types of online gambling in 2006. At the time, then-Governor Tom Vilsack said he was concerned about the proliferation of online casinos and poker rooms, which could lead to moral decay and addiction problems among Iowans.

Iowa is now one of six states with bans on online horse betting; the other states are Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana and Maryland. Nevada and Montana have laws that allow residents to bet on out-of-state races over the internet.

#  Massachusetts Moves to Criminalize Online Horse Gambling

In a sharp rebuke of the online horse gambling industry, the state of Massachusetts has announced plans to criminalize the activity. The measure, which is expected to be passed into law in the coming months, would make it a felony to place bets on horseraces over the internet.

The move by Massachusetts comes as other states are also considering similar measures. In New York, for example, Assemblyman Gary Pretlow has introduced a bill that would make online horse gambling a crime punishable by up to four years in prison.

Supporters of the crackdown say that it is needed to protect consumers from being scammed by unscrupulous operators. "These websites are nothing more than scams," said one state legislator. "They take advantage of people who don't know any better and end up losing their hard-earned money."

Opponents of the crackdown say that it will only push the industry underground, making it more difficult for regulators to keep track of what is going on. They also argue that online horse gambling is no different from other forms of online betting, which are currently legal in most states.

#  Online Horse Gambling a Felony in Texas

Texas law prohibits any form of gambling that takes place over the internet. Horse race betting and other online gambling is a felony offense in Texas.

In Texas, online poker, casino games and sports betting are all Class A misdemeanors. The punishment for a Class A misdemeanor is up to one year in jail and/or a $4,000 fine.

Online horse race betting is a felony offense in Texas punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.

The Texas Penal Code states that “A person commits an offense if he bets on the outcome of a race or sporting event”. Gambling is also illegal in Texas under the gaming statute but this includes traditional forms of gambling such as casino games and poker.

Sports betting is big business and there are many people who engage in it illegally. In order to combat illegal gambling, state legislatures have been passing laws making it illegal to bet on sports online.

As recently as February 2018, New Jersey became the third state after Nevada and Delaware to legalize sports betting within its borders following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports betting. This will likely lead to other states legalizing sports betting in an effort to generate tax revenue. However, it appears that online horse race betting will remain a felony offense in Texas for the time being.

#  Washington D.C. Outlaws Online Horse Gambling

As of this week, Washington D.C. has become the latest in a growing number of states to outlaw online horse gambling. The bill, known as the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, passed unanimously in the House of Representatives last week and was signed into law by Mayor Vincent Gray on Monday.

The legislation prohibits any form of online gambling, including but not limited to online poker, casino games and sports betting. It also forbids anyone within the District of Columbia from offering or accepting bets or wagers on horses or other sporting events over the Internet.

Reaction to the bill has been mixed, with some applauding the District for taking a stand against gambling addiction while others argue that it will only push gamblers underground and make it more difficult for authorities to track and regulate illegal activity.

Representative Jim Moran, who cosponsored the bill, said that it is important to protect people from the dangers of gambling addiction and that “the avalanche of dollars being lost through unregulated internet gambling is destroying families and livelihoods.”

Others disagree with this assessment, noting that online gambling is already tightly regulated and that banning it will only drive business underground where it will be less safe and more difficult to track. They argue that prohibition is not a solution – it’s just a Band-Aid trying to fix a problem that doesn’t exist.
