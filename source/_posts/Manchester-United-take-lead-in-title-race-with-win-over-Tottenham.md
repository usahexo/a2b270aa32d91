#  Manchester United take lead in title race with win over Tottenham

Manchester United took the lead in the title race with a 3-0 win over Tottenham at Old Trafford. Goals from Antonio Valencia, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Romelu Lukaku saw United take all three points and move to the top of the table.

Mourinho's men started brightly, and took the lead in the 10th minute when Valencia's header looped over Hugo Lloris into the net. Spurs had chances to get back into the game, but United doubled their lead in the 31st minute when Mkhitaryan's shot found the bottom corner of the net.

Lukaku made it 3-0 in the 66th minute with a powerful header, and United comfortably saw out the game to take another step towards winning their second Premier League title.

Elsewhere in the Premier League, Chelsea drew 1-1 with Liverpool at Anfield, while Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-1.

#  Mauricio Pochettino: We should have won

Mauricio Pochettino embarked on his post-match press conference with a sense of injustice. Tottenham had just lost by a goal to Newcastle United, and the manager felt that his team should have taken all three points. "I'm very disappointed because I think we deserved more," Pochettino said. "We dominated the game and created many chances."

Tottenham had certainly been the better team in the first half, but they were unable to make their dominance count. Newcastle took the lead in the second half when Matt Ritchie converted from the penalty spot, and Spurs were unable to find an equaliser. "In the first half we played very well and created some good chances," Pochettino said. "In the second half we conceded a penalty and then it was difficult for us."

Pochettino was also critical of the refereeing decision that led to Newcastle's penalty. He felt that Moussa Sissoko had fouled Dele Alli in the build-up to the incident, and he made it clear that he was not happy with the decision. "It was a clear foul on Dele Alli," Pochettino said. "The referee didn’t see it and we are very disappointed."

Despite the defeat, Pochettino remains positive about Tottenham's prospects for the season. The manager believes that his side can still finish in the top four, and he is confident that they will be able to compete for silverware this year. "We need to keep working hard," Pochettino said. "We are in a good position in both La Liga and the Champions League, and I believe we can achieve something this season."

#  Halle's goal drought continues following goalless draw against Augsburg

After failing to score in their goalless draw against Augsburg, Halle have now gone 9 games without a goal - their longest goal drought in club history.

Despite creating numerous chances throughout the game, they were unable to find the back of the net, with their best chance coming in the second half when they hit the post.

Manager Jürgen Klopp was clearly frustrated with the result, and said after the game that his side 'need to be more clinical in front of goal'.

Halle's next game is at home to Werder Bremen, and they will be desperate to get back to winning ways and end their goal drought.

#  Schalke 04 held to another frustrating draw

Schalke 04 conceded a late equalizer for the second game in a row, this time against Hertha Berlin.

The Royal Blues were held to a frustrating 2-2 draw by Hertha Berlin at the Olympiastadion on Saturday. It was Schalke’s second consecutive draw after they were held to a 1-1 stalemate by Augsburg last weekend.

 Goals from Guido Burgstaller and Weston McKennie were not enough to see off Hertha, who equalized in the 86th minute through Davie Selke. It means Schalke have now only won one of their last six Bundesliga games, and they remain in fourth place in the table, four points behind league leaders Bayern Munich.

Schalke boss Domenico Tedesco made three changes to the side that started against Augsburg last weekend. Burgstaller, McKennie and Amine Harit all came into the starting lineup, with Yevhen Konoplyanka, Bastian Oczipka and Franco Di Santo dropping to the bench.

Hertha Berlin had the first real chance of the game in the fifth minute when Salomon Kalou played a dangerous ball across goal which neither Vedad Ibisevic nor Selke could get on the end of. Schalke went close soon afterwards when Burgstaller’s header was tipped over the bar by Rune Jarstein in the Hertha goal.

The Royal Blues took the lead in the 17th minute when Burgstaller finished well from inside the penalty area after some good work from McKennie down the right wing. Schalke continued to look dangerous going forward and they could have doubled their lead moments later but for a fine save from Jarstein.

The home side began to get back into the game as half-time approached and they equalized shortly before the break through Selke, who headed in from close range after being left unmarked at a corner kick.

Schalke came out firing at the start of the second half and they went close twice within minutes of each other, but both efforts from Burgstaller were saved by Jarstein. The Royal Blues continued to dominate proceedings but they couldn’t find a way past a stubborn Hertha defense.

It looked like Schalke would have to settle for another draw until Selke scored his second goal of the game in stoppage time, volleying past Ralf Fährmann from close range after being played through on goal by Genki Haraguchi.

#  RB Leipzig record impressive victory over Hoffenheim

RB Leipzig put in a scintillating performance as they recorded a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Emil Forsberg opened the scoring after just two minutes, with Timo Werner doubling their lead midway through the first half. Yussuf Poulsen made it 3-0 shortly before the break, and Werner rounded off the scoring in stoppage time.

The result means that RB Leipzig have now won six of their last seven Bundesliga games, and they remain just two points behind Bayern Munich at the top of the table. Hoffenheim, meanwhile, have now lost four consecutive league games and find themselves just five points above the relegation playoff place.

Forsberg was RB Leipzig's star man on Saturday, as he scored one goal and played a role in all three of his side's other goals. He was unlucky not to score himself on a number of occasions, but his efforts were ultimately rewarded as he helped his team to an emphatic victory.

Werner was also impressive for RB Leipzig, as he continued his fine run of form in front of goal with another strike on Saturday. With 18 goals in all competitions this season, Werner is now one of the most lethal strikers in Europe, and he will be hoping to continue his good form in the second half of the season.
