#  The Untold Story of the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino

In March of 1978, a woman by the name of Kathy Boudin was caught running an illegal gambling operation out of the Las Vegas Casino. At first, the police had no idea who was behind the illegal gambling ring, but after a few weeks of investigating they were finally able to track down Kathy Boudin.

What made this case even more interesting was the fact that Kathy Boudin was a woman. Up until that point, most illegal gambling operations were run by men, so it was quite unusual for a woman to be caught running one.

At first, Kathy Boudin denied any involvement in the gambling ring, but eventually she confessed and admitted that she was the one responsible for it. She explained that she had set up the operation in order to make money for her and her son, and that she had no intention of hurting anyone.

The police were not convinced though, and they ended up arresting Kathy Boudin and charging her with conspiracy to commit racketeering. She ended up spending a year in jail, but she was never convicted of any crime.

Despite being caught red-handed, Kathy Boudin managed to get away with running an illegal gambling operation from a casino. This story is just another example of how sneaky and clever some people can be when it comes to breaking the law.

She was even profiled by several local media outlets as a businesswoman who had beaten the odds to make it big in Sin City.

Prior to her arrest, Desforge had been living a lavish lifestyle, complete with expensive cars and designer clothes. Now that her fortunes have changed, she is facing the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars.
