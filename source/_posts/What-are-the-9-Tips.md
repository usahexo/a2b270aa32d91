#  Do they work?

There’s a lot of talk in the fitness industry about whether or not supplements work. Many people seem to think that they don’t, and that you can get all the nutrients you need from food. But is this really true?

The answer is, it depends. In general, supplements can be helpful for getting certain nutrients that you may not be able to get from food alone. This includes things like protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D. However, it’s important to remember that supplements are just that – supplements. They should not be used as a replacement for a healthy diet.

If you’re looking to improve your overall health and fitness, the best thing you can do is focus on eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. Supplements can help support your goals, but they are not a substitute for a good diet and exercise regime.

#  How long do they last?

The lifespan of a typical mouse is about two years. This varies depending on the type of mouse and how well it is taken care of, but in general two years is a good estimate.

Mice are generally easy to care for, but there are a few things you can do to help them last longer. Make sure their food and water bowls are always clean and full, and check that their home is free of debris and pests. You should also periodically clean your mouse's cage with a mild detergent to remove any waste or build-up.

Mice can also suffer from health problems as they get older, so be on the lookout for signs that something may be wrong. If your mouse starts to lose weight, has trouble moving around, or seems to be in pain, it's best to take it to a veterinarian for a diagnosis.

#  What are the side effects of using them?

People may also experience weight gain or a loss in sex drive. More serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, serotonin syndrome, and mania.
