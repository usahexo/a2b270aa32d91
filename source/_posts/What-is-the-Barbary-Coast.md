#  What is the Barbary Coast?

Located in North Africa, the Barbary Coast was known for its piracy and slave trade. The Barbary Coast refers to a region of coastal North Africa from modern Tunisia west to Tripoli, Libya.

The name Barbary Coast is derived from the Berber people who lived there. The coast was known for its pirates, who plundered merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea. The Barbary pirates also raided coastal towns and villages in Europe, kidnapping locals for ransom or enslaving them.

The slave trade was an important part of the Barbary Coast economy. African slaves were brought to the coast and sold as slaves to North African rulers or European buyers. The slave trade continued until the early 19th century, when it was abolished by European countries.
