If you’re like me, you’ve been playing Grand Theft Auto 5 pretty much non-stop since it came out last fall. The game just never seems to get old, thanks to the amazing amount of content that Rockstar put into it.

The most recent addition to the game is the GTA Online Heists DLC, which added 4 new co-op missions that are a blast to play with friends.

This new DLC is called the Casino Missions Pack, and it includes 10 new solo missions that take place in the casino district of Los Santos. These missions are all about stealing money and valuables from the casinos, and they offer a lot of variety in terms of gameplay.

And since they’re all set in the casino district, they also look great – especially when viewed from high up in the sky using one of the game’s many aerial vehicles.
