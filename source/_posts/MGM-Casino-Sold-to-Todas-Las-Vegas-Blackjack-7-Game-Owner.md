The new owners, Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, plan to rebrand the casino and invest millions of dollars in upgrades. "We are very excited to be entering the U.S. market," said Great Canadian Gaming CEO Rod Baker in a statement. "This property is a great fit with our company's strategy of acquiring well-located regional casinos."

#  MGM Casino to be Renamed Following Sale to Canadian Gaming Company

After being acquired by a Canadian gaming company, the MGM casino will be renamed to "Casino Montreal". The Quebec-based company, Loto-Quebec, announced the purchase on Tuesday and predicted that the move would create up to 1,000 jobs in the province.

The new name is set to take effect within the next few weeks and will apply to both the casino's land-based and online operations. Loto-Quebec said that it would invest CAD$270 million (USD$202 million) into Casino Montreal, with plans to upgrade the facilities and attract new customers.

"This is a new page for Casino Montreal. An ambitious project that will give players state-of-the-art gaming," said Geoge Coppola, CEO of Loto-Quebec. "It's also excellent news for our employees who will benefit from more stable jobs and career development opportunities."

The sale comes as MGM undergoes a major restructuring following its bankruptcy filing last year. Casino Montreal is one of the largest gaming venues in North America, with annual revenue of CAD$1.2 billion (USD$905 million).

#  New Owners of MGM Casino Welcomed Amidst Controversy

The new owners of MGM casino have been welcomed with open arms by many in the gambling community, despite some controversy. The sale of the casino has been a long and drawn out process, with many interested parties vying for ownership.

Finally, it was announced that MGM casino had been sold to a group of investors led by Steve Wynn. Wynn is no stranger to the casino business, and is considered one of the most successful casino entrepreneurs in the world.

Wynn has wasted no time in making changes at MGM, and has already fired a number of high-ranking employees. This move has angered many within the company, but Wynn is confident that he can turn MGM around and make it into a profitable venture.

The new owners have also come under fire for their ties to organized crime. It has been revealed that one of the investors in the group is affiliated with the Genovese crime family. This has raised concerns about the safety and security of MGM casino.

Despite these concerns, many remain optimistic about the future of MGM casino under its new ownership. Wynn is a proven entrepreneur, and there is no doubt that he will do everything in his power to make MGM a success.
