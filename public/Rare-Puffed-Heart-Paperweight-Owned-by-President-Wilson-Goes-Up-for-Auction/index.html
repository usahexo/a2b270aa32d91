The paperweight is a glass sphere that has been intricately sculpted to resemble a heart. It is estimated that the paperweight will sell for between $2,000 and $4,000.</p>
<p>The paperweight was created by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. At the time, Wilson was serving as the 28th President of the United States. He presented the paperweight as a gift to his wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson. Mrs. Wilson was known for her fondness of delicate glassware and art.</p>
<p>The paperweight is one of only a handful that are known to still exist. It is made of lead-glass and features a deep red color. The heart has been carefully sculpted and features ornate details, including floral designs and scrollwork.</p>
<p>The upcoming auction is being organized by RR Auction House. The proceeds from the sale will be donated to charity. This is not the first time that President Wilson’s Puffed Heart Paperweight has been auctioned off. In 2008, it sold at auction for $21,000.</p>
<p>The paperweight is an interesting piece of presidential history and it is sure to attract attention from collectors and historians alike. It provides a unique glimpse into the personal life of President Woodrow Wilson and his wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson.</p>

The paperweight is made of glass and metal, and is about 4 inches in diameter. It was given to Wilson by the Japanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.</p>
<p>The inscription on the paperweight reads “From the Japanese Delegation to Woodrow Wilson, April 6th, 1919.” It is believed that the paperweight was given to Wilson as a gesture of goodwill, in recognition of his role in negotiating the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>Wilson was President of the United States from 1913-1921, and is considered one of the most influential presidents in American history. He played a leading role in negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I.</p>
<p>The paperweight is being auctioned off by Heritage Auctions on May 18th. It is expected to sell for between $3,000 and $5,000.</p>

<p>The Wilson Estate’s Baccarat puffed heart paperweight was given to them as a gift by president John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in 1961. It is one of only three known examples of this style paperweight that were personally given to someone by the Kennedys.</p>
