On one side of the argument, there are those who believe that casino ownership should be in the hands of the government in order to ensure fairness and regulation. On the other side, there are those who believe that casino ownership should be privatized so that companies can compete for licenses and generate profits. One such debate is taking place in Cherokee, North Carolina, where Harrah’s Cherokee Casino is at the center of a heated dispute between two groups: the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Caesars Entertainment Corporation.</p>
<p>The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians owns Harrah’s Cherokee Casino, which it operates under a gaming compact with the state of North Carolina. The tribe negotiated an exclusive 25-year compact with the state in 1995 that gives it exclusive rights to operate casinos on Indian land. In exchange, the tribe pays 25 percent of its net slot machine proceeds to the state. In 2010, however, amendments were made to the compact that allowed for a second casino to be built in Cherokee. That casino, owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, opened its doors in 2014.</p>
<p>The tribe has filed a lawsuit against Caesars Entertainment Corporation, arguing that the company violated the terms of its license agreement by opening a competing casino in Cherokee. Caesars Entertainment Corporation denies any wrongdoing and argues that it was within its rights to open a competing casino pursuant to the amended gaming compact. The case is currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>
<p>While this particular case is pending before a court, it serves as a good example of the controversy surrounding casino ownership. On one hand, there are those who argue that casinos should be owned and operated by governments in order to protect consumers and ensure fairness. On the other hand, there are those who argue that casinos should be privatized so that companies can compete for licenses and generate profits. This debate is sure to continue well into the future as states consider whether or not to allow casinos within their borders.</p>
