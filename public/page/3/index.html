        <h1 id="The-Untold-Story-of-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#The-Untold-Story-of-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Untold Story of the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino"></a>The Untold Story of the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>In March of 1978, a woman by the name of Kathy Boudin was caught running an illegal gambling operation out of the Las Vegas Casino. At first, the police had no idea who was behind the illegal gambling ring, but after a few weeks of investigating they were finally able to track down Kathy Boudin.</p>
<p>What made this case even more interesting was the fact that Kathy Boudin was a woman. Up until that point, most illegal gambling operations were run by men, so it was quite unusual for a woman to be caught running one.</p>
<p>At first, Kathy Boudin denied any involvement in the gambling ring, but eventually she confessed and admitted that she was the one responsible for it. She explained that she had set up the operation in order to make money for her and her son, and that she had no intention of hurting anyone.</p>
<p>The police were not convinced though, and they ended up arresting Kathy Boudin and charging her with conspiracy to commit racketeering. She ended up spending a year in jail, but she was never convicted of any crime.</p>
<p>Despite being caught red-handed, Kathy Boudin managed to get away with running an illegal gambling operation from a casino. This story is just another example of how sneaky and clever some people can be when it comes to breaking the law.</p>
<h1 id="The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Rise and Fall of the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino"></a>The Rise and Fall of the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>The woman who ran an illegal gambling operation from a Las Vegas casino for over two years is facing a potential prison sentence after being found guilty on all counts Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say that 56-year-old Linda Desforge took in over $1 million in bets between November 2014 and October 2016, operating out of the Silver Slipper casino.</p>
<p>She was originally indicted on 11 felony charges in December, but a superseding indictment handed down in March added another four charges, including engaging in organized criminal activity.</p>
<p>Desforge could face up to 99 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>The news of Desforge’s arrest comes as a surprise to many in the gaming community, as she was considered one of the most successful and well-known blackjack dealers in Las Vegas. She was even profiled by several local media outlets as a businesswoman who had beaten the odds to make it big in Sin City.</p>
<p>Prior to her arrest, Desforge had been living a lavish lifestyle, complete with expensive cars and designer clothes. Now that her fortunes have changed, she is facing the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-Conquered-the-Strip"><a href="#How-the-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-Conquered-the-Strip" class="headerlink" title="How the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino Conquered the Strip"></a>How the Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino Conquered the Strip</h1><p>Susan Gaming was born in Las Vegas, the daughter of a well-known Mafia member. When she was just eighteen years old, Susan took over her father’s illegal gambling operation that was run out of one of the biggest casinos on the Strip. Susan proved to be a shrewd businesswoman, and soon her gambling ring was earning more money than ever before. She paid off the casino management, police officers, and even the mobsters who had once been her father’s rivals.</p>
<p>Susan’s success allowed her to live a life of luxury. She bought a multimillion-dollar home in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Las Vegas, and she drove around town in a Rolls Royce. Her gambling ring became known as the “most profitable underground business in Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>Eventually, however, Susan’s luck ran out. In 2001, she was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation. She spent six months in prison, but when she got out she vowed to start over. She retired from the gambling business and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Susan is eighty years old and lives a quiet life away from the bright lights of Las Vegas. But she’ll always be remembered as the woman who conquered the Strip.</p>
<h1 id="The-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-The-gambler’s-story"><a href="#The-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-The-gambler’s-story" class="headerlink" title="The Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino: The gambler’s story"></a>The Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino: The gambler’s story</h1><p>Illegal gambling is a serious business, and those who engage in it often face serious consequences if they’re caught. But what happens when the person running the illegal gambling operation is also the one taking the risks?</p>
<p>That’s the story of Kathy Shea, a woman who ran an illegal gambling ring from a Las Vegas casino for more than two years before finally getting caught. Her tale is one of determination and grit, as she managed to keep her business going despite being constantly on the run from the police.</p>
<p>Shea started out small, setting up a few poker games in her hotel room. But as her business grew, she needed a bigger venue, and eventually moved her operations to the casino. There, she set up tables for blackjack, roulette, and craps and began taking bets from her customers.</p>
<p>The casino was happy to have her business; after all, it was bringing in extra revenue without having to do any of the work itself. And Shea was happy too; she was making good money and living the high life.</p>
<p>But things eventually came crashing down for Shea. In 2009, she was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation. She faced up to five years in prison, but fortunately managed to get off with a slap on the wrist: 18 months probation.</p>
<p>Despite getting caught, Shea hasn’t given up on gambling; in fact, she’s been known to take occasional trips to Las Vegas still! Her story is a reminder that even when things seem bad, there’s always a chance for redemption.</p>
<h1 id="The-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-The-inside-story"><a href="#The-Woman-Who-Ran-an-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-from-Las-Vegas-Casino-The-inside-story" class="headerlink" title="The Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino: The inside story"></a>The Woman Who Ran an Illegal Gambling Operation from Las Vegas Casino: The inside story</h1><p>She was known as the “Queen of the Casino” in Las Vegas, but very few people knew the true story behind her. For years, she ran an illegal gambling operation out of a casino, making millions of dollars in the process. Here is the inside story of the woman who ran an illegal gambling operation from a Las Vegas casino.</p>
<p>It all started back in the 1980s, when casino gambling was just starting to become popular in Las Vegas. The woman had worked in casinos for many years, and she knew that there was money to be made by running an illegal gambling operation. So she started to take bets from her friends and co-workers at the casino where she worked.</p>
<p>Before long, word got out about her gambling operation, and people started coming to her from all over Las Vegas to place bets. She quickly became known as the “Queen of the Casino”, and her business grew rapidly. She soon began hiring people to help her run the gambling operation, and before long she was making millions of dollars a year.</p>
<p>The woman kept her gambling operation secret for many years, but eventually she was caught by the authorities. She was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation, and she spent several years in prison. But even today, she still insists that she did nothing wrong and that she was simply providing a service that people wanted.</p>

        <h1 id="What-Percentage-Of-Winnings-Are-Taxed-In-Canada"><a href="#What-Percentage-Of-Winnings-Are-Taxed-In-Canada" class="headerlink" title="What Percentage Of Winnings Are Taxed In Canada?"></a>What Percentage Of Winnings Are Taxed In Canada?</h1><p>Compared to other countries, Canada has a fairly complex tax system when it comes to gambling winnings. There are three different types of taxes that may be applied, and the percentage that each one takes can vary quite a bit depending on the amount won.</p>
<p>The first type of tax is federal income tax. This is a mandatory tax that everyone in Canada must pay on their income, regardless of whether or not they gamble. The percentage that you have to pay will depend on your income level and filing status. For example, in 2018 the highest tax rate was 33%, while the lowest was 15%.</p>
<p>The second type of tax is provincial income tax. This is also a mandatory tax, but it applies only to residents of certain provinces. The percentage that you have to pay will again depend on your income level and filing status, but it is generally lower than the federal income tax rate.</p>
<p>The third type of tax is called the “hobby loss” deduction. This is a voluntary deduction that you can claim if you lose money gambling in any given year. The amount that you can deduct will depend on your total losses for the year, and there is a limit of $2,500 per year. Note that this deduction can only be claimed if you report your gambling winnings and losses accurately on your taxes.</p>
<p>So how does all this add up? Let’s take a hypothetical example. Suppose you won $10,000 from gambling in 2018. Here’s how the taxes would break down:</p>
<p>-Federal income tax: $3,333 (33% of $10,000)<br>-Provincial income tax: $0 (assuming you live in a province with no provincial income tax)<br>-Hobby loss deduction: $2,500 (assuming you had total gambling losses for 2018 of at least $2,500)</p>
<p>This means that in total, you would end up paying $5,833 in taxes on your gambling winnings ($3,333 + $2,500). That’s a 58% effective tax rate.</p>
<h1 id="Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada"><a href="#Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada" class="headerlink" title="Taxes On Gambling Winnings In Canada"></a>Taxes On Gambling Winnings In Canada</h1><p>When you gamble and win, the government wants its share. Gambling income is taxable in Canada, just like any other type of income.</p>
<p>There are a few things to know about taxes on gambling winnings in Canada. First of all, not everyone has to pay taxes on their winnings. You only have to pay taxes on your gambling income if it exceeds your total gambling losses for the year. In other words, you can only owe taxes on your net gambling gain for the year.</p>
<p>If you do have to pay taxes on your gambling income, the amount you owe will be based on your taxable income for the year. For example, if your taxable income is $50,000 and you earn $2,000 from gambling, you will owe tax on $1,000 (the difference between your taxable income and gambling income). The tax rate for this amount will be based on your marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>There are some special rules that apply to certain types of gambling income. Gambling winnings from a slot machine or video lottery terminal are considered fully taxable, while winning bets on horseracing and dog racing are considered 50% taxable. All other types of gambling wins are considered fully taxable.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income or how much tax you may owe, be sure to speak with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Tax-Is-Paid-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada"><a href="#How-Much-Tax-Is-Paid-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada" class="headerlink" title="How Much Tax Is Paid On Gambling Winnings In Canada?"></a>How Much Tax Is Paid On Gambling Winnings In Canada?</h1><p>Gambling in Canada is a popular pastime and it’s no secret that Canadians love to gamble. In fact, gambling is such a big part of our culture that we even have our own national lottery, the Lotto 6/49. So how much tax do you have to pay on your gambling winnings in Canada?</p>
<p>In most cases, you don’t have to pay any tax on your gambling winnings. Gambling income is generally considered to be non- taxable income in Canada. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, if you win a car or other prize worth more than $1,000 Canadian dollars, you will have to pay taxes on the fair market value of the prize.</p>
<p>There is also a provincial tax on gambling winnings that varies depending on where you live in Canada. For example, in Ontario the tax is 8% on wins above $500 while in Manitoba the tax is 15% on all winnings.</p>
<p>So if you hit the jackpot at the casino or won big playing the slots, there’s no need to worry about paying taxes on your winnings. However, if you take home a smaller prize, you may have to pay a small amount of tax. But either way, gambling income is considered non-taxable in Canada so you can enjoy your wins without having to worry about Uncle Sam taking his share!</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-The-Rate-Of-Taxation-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada"><a href="#What-Is-The-Rate-Of-Taxation-On-Gambling-Winnings-In-Canada" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Rate Of Taxation On Gambling Winnings In Canada?"></a>What Is The Rate Of Taxation On Gambling Winnings In Canada?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there are a few things that you need to take into account. The first is understanding the taxation laws on gambling wins in your jurisdiction. This is especially important if you happen to win a large sum of money.</p>
<p>In Canada, gambling wins are subject to tax at the same rate as regular income. This means that any amount you earn from gambling is taxable at your marginal tax rate. For example, if you are in the 39% tax bracket, then 39% of your gambling winnings would be taxed.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings when calculating your taxable income. In addition, certain types of gambling winnings are not taxed. These include prizes and awards from provincial or territorial lottery schemes, as well as some sweepstakes and raffles.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling winnings or deductions, be sure to speak with an accountant or other tax specialist.</p>
<h1 id="How-Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxed-In-Canada"><a href="#How-Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxed-In-Canada" class="headerlink" title="How Are Gambling Winnings Taxed In Canada?"></a>How Are Gambling Winnings Taxed In Canada?</h1><p>As a Canadian taxpayer, you’re likely aware that gambling winnings are taxable. But just how much tax do you have to pay on your winnings? And what happens if you lose money gambling?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll answer all of your questions about gambling and taxes in Canada. We’ll start by talking about the different types of gambling and how they’re taxed. Then we’ll go over the rules for reporting gambling income and losses. And finally, we’ll talk about some tips to help you stay on top of your taxes.</p>
<p>So let’s get started!</p>
<p>How Are Gambling Winnings Taxed In Canada?</p>
<p>Gambling winnings are taxable in Canada, and you have to report them on your tax return. The amount of tax you pay depends on the type of gambling and the amount of money you win.</p>
<p>Here are the basic rules for paying taxes on gambling income in Canada:</p>
<p>-You have to report any gambling income from casinos, lottery tickets, or sports bets. This includes both cash and prizes.<br>-You can deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling income. This includes both cash and prizes. So if you lose $600 at the casino, but only win $300, you would only have to report $300 in income on your tax return. </p>
<p> -Gambling income is taxed as regular income. So you can expect to pay approximately 25%tax on it (depending on your province or territory).-If you have a regular job and also gamble regularly, you may be able to claim some of your gambling losses as a business expense. We’ll talk more about this later. </p>

The first and most obvious sign is if your family member is constantly asking to borrow money or spending more than they can afford on games of chance. If your loved one is lying about their gambling habits or trying to hide their behavior, that is another red flag. Another indication that there may be a problem is if your family member becomes irritable or argumentative when discussing gambling-related topics. If your loved one experiences withdrawal symptoms like mood swings, restlessness, or insomnia after stopping gambling, that could also be a warning sign. If you suspect that someone in your family has a gambling problem, it’s important to talk to them about it and provide support. You can find helpful resources at Gamblers Anonymous or National Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<h1 id="5-signs-your-family-member-may-have-a-gambling-problem-with-Egyptian-Fortunes"><a href="#5-signs-your-family-member-may-have-a-gambling-problem-with-Egyptian-Fortunes" class="headerlink" title="5 signs your family member may have a gambling problem with Egyptian Fortunes"></a>5 signs your family member may have a gambling problem with Egyptian Fortunes</h1><p>Most people gamble without ever developing a problem, but for some, gambling can become addictive and ruin their lives. It’s important to be able to spot the signs of a gambling addiction in your loved ones so that you can get them help if needed. Here are 5 signs your family member may have a gambling problem with Egyptian Fortunes:</p>
<ol>
<li>They seem preoccupied with gambling and Egyptian Fortunes in particular.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your loved one is always talking about gambling and how they’re going to win big at Egyptian Fortunes, there’s a good chance they have a problem. Gambling should just be a form of entertainment for them, not the focus of their life.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>They regularly bet more money than they can afford to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your loved one is always betting more money than they can afford to lose, it’s a clear sign that their addiction has taken over. They may even try to borrow money or sell possessions in order to keep betting.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Their mood changes dramatically when they lose money gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>When someone is addicted to gambling, losing money can cause them to become angry, depressed or even violent. If your loved one has these types of reactions after losing at Egyptian Fortunes, it’s a sign that they need help.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>They’re secretive about their gambling habit.</li>
</ol>
<p>People with gambling addictions often try to keep their habit secret from friends and family members. If your loved one is constantly hiding their bets or lying about where they’ve been, there’s a good chance they’re hiding something else too.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Their financial situation has deteriorated because of gambling debts.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your loved one has started borrowing money or selling possessions to pay off gambling debts, it’s clear that their addiction has gotten out of control. Gambling debts can quickly spiral out of control and ruin someone’s financial stability completely.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-help-a-loved-one-who-may-have-a-gambling-problem-with-Egyptian-Fortunes"><a href="#How-to-help-a-loved-one-who-may-have-a-gambling-problem-with-Egyptian-Fortunes" class="headerlink" title="How to help a loved one who may have a gambling problem with Egyptian Fortunes"></a>How to help a loved one who may have a gambling problem with Egyptian Fortunes</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but for some people it can become a serious problem. If you have a loved one who may have a gambling problem, there are ways you can help them.</p>
<p>The first step is to talk to your loved one about their gambling. express your concerns and let them know that you want to help them. If they are receptive, discuss the possible solutions and ask for their input.</p>
<p>One option is to limit or prohibit your loved one from gambling altogether. This may not be possible or desirable, however, so another option is to set rules for gambling. You might agree on a budget that your loved one can spend on gambling each week or month, or you could require them to leave their credit cards at home when they go to the casino.</p>
<p>It’s also important to be supportive and understanding. Gambling addiction can be a difficult thing to overcome, so your loved one will need your encouragement and positive reinforcement. Set aside time for regular discussions about their progress and offer words of encouragement when they struggle.</p>
<p>If your loved one is willing, consider joining a support group together. These groups provide a safe place for people with gambling addictions to talk about their experiences and get support from others who are going through the same thing.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that recovery takes time. Don’t expect your loved one to change overnight, but rather give them the time and space they need to make progress. With patience and dedication, you can help your loved one overcome their gambling addiction and regain control of their life.</p>

<p>Another red flag is if someone starts lying about their gambling or withdrawing from social activities in order to gamble instead. Finally, if someone experiences negative consequences as a result of their gambling (e.g., financial problems, relationship issues), this is also typically a sign that something is wrong.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Get support from others who are affected by gambling addiction.</li>

        <h1 id="Bingo-Poker-and-Casino-Games-Now-Tax-Deductible-in-Zimbabwe"><a href="#Bingo-Poker-and-Casino-Games-Now-Tax-Deductible-in-Zimbabwe" class="headerlink" title="Bingo, Poker and Casino Games Now Tax-Deductible in Zimbabwe!"></a>Bingo, Poker and Casino Games Now Tax-Deductible in Zimbabwe!</h1><p>The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) has announced that bingo, poker, and casino games are now tax-deductible in the country. This means that any player who spends money on these games can write them off as a business expense.</p>
<p>This new policy took effect on January 1, 2018. It covers all forms of bingo, poker, and casino games, including online and offline versions. Players can deduct any amount they spend on these games from their taxable income.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how this will impact the Zimbabwean gaming market. However, it’s likely that this will lead to an increase in gambling activity. It may also encourage more people to start up gambling businesses in the country.</p>
<p>This is a major development for the Zimbabwean gaming industry. The previous tax regime made gambling a less attractive option for players and businesses alike. With the new deduction rules in place, we can expect to see a lot more interest in gambling in Zimbabwe</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Can-Now-be-Written-Off-as-Tax-Deductions-in-Zimbabwe"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Can-Now-be-Written-Off-as-Tax-Deductions-in-Zimbabwe" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Can Now be Written Off as Tax Deductions in Zimbabwe"></a>Gambling Losses Can Now be Written Off as Tax Deductions in Zimbabwe</h1><p>Gamblers in Zimbabwe can now write off their gambling losses as tax deductions. The Inland Revenue Authority of Zimbabwe (IRAZ) said in a statement that gambling losses incurred in a financial year can now be deducted from the taxable income of the taxpayer. The ruling applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries.</p>
<p>The development is likely to encourage more people to gamble, as they can reduce their tax liabilities by doing so. It is also likely to benefit the gambling industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to economic constraints in the country.</p>
<p>The IRAZ said that the new ruling would help to promote fairness and equity in the taxation system. It also said that it was important to recognize the losses incurred by gamblers, as they are often unable to offset them against any other form of income.</p>
<p>The new ruling comes into effect from 1 January 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Deductible-Gambling-Expenses-Approved-for-Zimbabwean-Businesses"><a href="#Tax-Deductible-Gambling-Expenses-Approved-for-Zimbabwean-Businesses" class="headerlink" title="Tax Deductible Gambling Expenses Approved for Zimbabwean Businesses"></a>Tax Deductible Gambling Expenses Approved for Zimbabwean Businesses</h1><p>The Zimbabwean government has announced that businesses can now claim tax deductible gambling expenses. This move is part of the government’s efforts to revive the ailing economy.</p>
<p>According to the Minister of Finance, business owners can now deduct the costs of any legitimate gambling activity from their taxable income. This includes spending on lotteries, betting, and casino games.</p>
<p>The new policy is expected to help businesses in Zimbabwe to reduce their taxable income and pay less tax. It will also encourage more people to gamble, which is likely to generate more revenue for the government.</p>
<p> business owners should keep detailed records of all gambling activities, including the amount spent and the winnings or losses incurred. These records should be kept for at least 5 years in case of an audit by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA).</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Now-Officially-Recognized-as-a-Legitimate-Business-Activity-in-Zimbabwe"><a href="#Gambling-Now-Officially-Recognized-as-a-Legitimate-Business-Activity-in-Zimbabwe" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Now Officially Recognized as a Legitimate Business Activity in Zimbabwe"></a>Gambling Now Officially Recognized as a Legitimate Business Activity in Zimbabwe</h1><p>The Zimbabwean government has finally come to realize the potential in the gambling industry and has now legalized it as a business activity. This move is likely to see a surge in investment in the sector as well as an increase in the number of people employed in it.</p>
<p>The government has set out a number of regulations that gambling operators must adhere to if they want to benefit from this new development. These include obtaining a license from the regulator, paying taxes, and ensuring that their customers are protected from harm.</p>
<p>Gambling was already happening in Zimbabwe, but it was taking place illegally. This meant that the operators were not licensed and were not paying taxes. This also meant that there was no regulation of the industry and that customers were exposed to risk.</p>
<p>Now that gambling is legal, things will be different. Licensed operators will have to pay taxes and will be subject to regulation. This will ensure that customers are protected and that the industry is operating fairly. It will also help to create a more sustainable gambling industry in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is not the first country to recognize gambling as a legitimate business activity. A number of other countries have done so, including South Africa, Australia, and the United Kingdom. This move by the Zimbabwean government is part of an effort to attract investment into the country and to stimulate economic growth.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Tax-Incentives-Signed-Into-Law-in-Zimbabwe"><a href="#Gambling-Tax-Incentives-Signed-Into-Law-in-Zimbabwe" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Tax Incentives Signed Into Law in Zimbabwe"></a>Gambling Tax Incentives Signed Into Law in Zimbabwe</h1><p>Gambling tax incentives have been signed into law by the president of Zimbabwe, after being approved by parliament in Harare. The new legislation offers a 50% rebate on gambling taxes for companies that generate annual turnover of more than $1 million.</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Patrick Chinamasa, believes that the new rebate will help to attract foreign investors to the gambling industry, as well as encourage local businesses to grow their operations. Gambling is seen as a major contributor to the country’s economy, with an estimated turnover of $2 billion last year.</p>
<p>The new rebate is part of wider efforts by the government to revive the economy, which has been struggling for the past two years. In addition to attracting foreign investment, the government is also looking to reduce its debt burden and promote export-led growth.</p>
<p>The gambling industry has been growing rapidly in Zimbabwe in recent years, thanks in part to a relaxation of laws governing the sector. Casino operators such as Sun International and Rainbow Tourism Group have been investing heavily in the country, and there are now over 140 licensed gambling outlets.</p>
<p>Despite this growth, the industry has come under criticism from some groups who argue that it encourages gambling addiction and social ills. There have also been concerns that the industry is not generating enough tax revenue for the government.</p>
<p>The new gambling tax incentive will come into effect on 1 January 2017.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t believe it,” Siems told local reporters. “I’ve been playing slots for years and I’ve never had anything like this happen.”</p>
<p>Siems said he plans to use the money to pay off some bills and take a vacation with his family. “We’re going to Disney World,” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>While casino officials have yet to comment on the malfunction, one gaming expert speculated that it may have been caused by a stuck coin or an out-of-order sensor. Whatever the cause, Siems is just happy to have hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>Wagering Tables is a casino game that simulates horseracing, using cards instead of horses. The object of the game is to correctly predict which numbered card will be drawn next from the deck, using either your own hand or information shared by other players at the table.</p>
<p>The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, numbered 2 through Ace. After the first card is drawn, players can make one of three possible wagers: whether the next card will be higher than the first (called a “High” bet), lower than the first (a “Low” bet), or equal to the first (a “Match” bet).</p>
<p>After each subsequent card is drawn, players can either place new bets or adjust their existing ones. The amount wagered on any given bet depends on the point value of the two cards involved; for example, a High wager on a 6 and an 8 would be worth 4 points, while a Low wager on those same numbers would be worth 2 points.</p>
<p>At the end of the hand, whoever has wagered on the correct outcome collects points from all other players at the table. The player with the most points at the end of the hand is declared the winner!</p>

This new crackdown, announced by the Michigan attorney general’s office on July 2, 2019, is part of a broader effort to target illegal gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Michigan residents are no longer able to gamble on horses through online platforms such as websites and apps. Violators could face misdemeanor charges and fines of up to $1,000.</p>
<p>“Online horse racing and wagering is illegal in Michigan,” said Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement. “This crackdown is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Michigan consumers from illegal gambling activities.”</p>
<p>The announcement of the crackdown has drawn criticism from some people who argue that it makes it difficult for law-abiding citizens to place legitimate bets on horse races. However, officials say that they are simply enforcing existing laws, and that residents can still place bets at physical race tracks or through licensed online gambling platforms.</p>
<p>Illegal online horse betting is a problem nationwide, with estimates that it accounts for as much as $3 billion in wagers each year. In March 2019, federal authorities announced a crackdown on illegal horse betting operations, arresting dozens of people and seizing millions of dollars in assets.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Horse-Gambling-Banned-in-Iowa-Again"><a href="#Online-Horse-Gambling-Banned-in-Iowa-Again" class="headerlink" title="Online Horse Gambling Banned in Iowa Again!"></a>Online Horse Gambling Banned in Iowa Again!</h1><p>The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission has renewed its ban on online horse gambling, making it the second state to take such a step.</p>
<p>The unanimous vote by the commission on Wednesday means that Iowans will not be able to bet on races run anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Commission chairman Jeff Lamberti said the panel made the decision after hearing from law enforcement and others that illegal gambling is flourishing in Iowa.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that our prohibition on Internet wagering is not stopping Iowans from gambling on horses,” Lamberti said. “In fact, it may be encouraging some to move away from regulated, taxed and safe gambling options to unlawful ones.”</p>
<p>The anti-gambling sentiment in Iowa comes as no surprise; the state was one of the first to pass a law banning all types of online gambling in 2006. At the time, then-Governor Tom Vilsack said he was concerned about the proliferation of online casinos and poker rooms, which could lead to moral decay and addiction problems among Iowans.</p>
<p>Iowa is now one of six states with bans on online horse betting; the other states are Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana and Maryland. Nevada and Montana have laws that allow residents to bet on out-of-state races over the internet.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-Moves-to-Criminalize-Online-Horse-Gambling"><a href="#Massachusetts-Moves-to-Criminalize-Online-Horse-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts Moves to Criminalize Online Horse Gambling"></a>Massachusetts Moves to Criminalize Online Horse Gambling</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In a sharp rebuke of the online horse gambling industry, the state of Massachusetts has announced plans to criminalize the activity. The measure, which is expected to be passed into law in the coming months, would make it a felony to place bets on horseraces over the internet.</p>
<p>The move by Massachusetts comes as other states are also considering similar measures. In New York, for example, Assemblyman Gary Pretlow has introduced a bill that would make online horse gambling a crime punishable by up to four years in prison.</p>
<p>Supporters of the crackdown say that it is needed to protect consumers from being scammed by unscrupulous operators. “These websites are nothing more than scams,” said one state legislator. “They take advantage of people who don’t know any better and end up losing their hard-earned money.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the crackdown say that it will only push the industry underground, making it more difficult for regulators to keep track of what is going on. They also argue that online horse gambling is no different from other forms of online betting, which are currently legal in most states.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Horse-Gambling-a-Felony-in-Texas"><a href="#Online-Horse-Gambling-a-Felony-in-Texas" class="headerlink" title="Online Horse Gambling a Felony in Texas"></a>Online Horse Gambling a Felony in Texas</h1><p>Texas law prohibits any form of gambling that takes place over the internet. Horse race betting and other online gambling is a felony offense in Texas.</p>
<p>In Texas, online poker, casino games and sports betting are all Class A misdemeanors. The punishment for a Class A misdemeanor is up to one year in jail and/or a $4,000 fine.</p>
<p>Online horse race betting is a felony offense in Texas punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>The Texas Penal Code states that “A person commits an offense if he bets on the outcome of a race or sporting event”. Gambling is also illegal in Texas under the gaming statute but this includes traditional forms of gambling such as casino games and poker.</p>
<p>Sports betting is big business and there are many people who engage in it illegally. In order to combat illegal gambling, state legislatures have been passing laws making it illegal to bet on sports online.</p>
<p>As recently as February 2018, New Jersey became the third state after Nevada and Delaware to legalize sports betting within its borders following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports betting. This will likely lead to other states legalizing sports betting in an effort to generate tax revenue. However, it appears that online horse race betting will remain a felony offense in Texas for the time being.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-D-C-Outlaws-Online-Horse-Gambling"><a href="#Washington-D-C-Outlaws-Online-Horse-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington D.C. Outlaws Online Horse Gambling"></a>Washington D.C. Outlaws Online Horse Gambling</h1><p>As of this week, Washington D.C. has become the latest in a growing number of states to outlaw online horse gambling. The bill, known as the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, passed unanimously in the House of Representatives last week and was signed into law by Mayor Vincent Gray on Monday.</p>
<p>The legislation prohibits any form of online gambling, including but not limited to online poker, casino games and sports betting. It also forbids anyone within the District of Columbia from offering or accepting bets or wagers on horses or other sporting events over the Internet.</p>
<p>Reaction to the bill has been mixed, with some applauding the District for taking a stand against gambling addiction while others argue that it will only push gamblers underground and make it more difficult for authorities to track and regulate illegal activity.</p>
<p>Representative Jim Moran, who cosponsored the bill, said that it is important to protect people from the dangers of gambling addiction and that “the avalanche of dollars being lost through unregulated internet gambling is destroying families and livelihoods.”</p>
<p>Others disagree with this assessment, noting that online gambling is already tightly regulated and that banning it will only drive business underground where it will be less safe and more difficult to track. They argue that prohibition is not a solution – it’s just a Band-Aid trying to fix a problem that doesn’t exist.</p>

        <h1 id="Springfield-Welcomes-New-Gambling-Resort"><a href="#Springfield-Welcomes-New-Gambling-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Springfield Welcomes New Gambling Resort!"></a>Springfield Welcomes New Gambling Resort!</h1><p>It’s been a long time in the making, but finally Springfield welcomes its new gambling resort! The casino has been built on the edge of town, and features all the latest games and attractions.</p>
<p>The renovation of the old factory has been a big project, but it’s been worth it to see the pleasure on people’s faces as they win big jackpots. There are slots, poker tables, and even a race track for those who want to get their adrenaline pumping.</p>
<p>The casino is open 24 hours a day, so there’s always something to do. Whether you’re looking for a place to relax after a hard day’s work or you’re in the mood for some excitement, Springfield’s new gambling resort has something for everyone.</p>
<h1 id="Springfield-Couple-Enjoys-Life-After-Gambling-Legalization"><a href="#Springfield-Couple-Enjoys-Life-After-Gambling-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="Springfield Couple Enjoys Life After Gambling Legalization"></a>Springfield Couple Enjoys Life After Gambling Legalization</h1><p>Joshua and Samantha have been married for 5 years and they have 2 kids. They both work fulltime jobs and they have a small home in Springfield. Joshua enjoyed going to the casino on the weekends, but Samantha never wanted to go. She always said that it was a waste of money.</p>
<p>However, things changed when gambling was legalized in their state. Now, the two of them can go to the casino together and enjoy each other’s company while playing the slots or table games. They’ve even managed to win a little bit of money together, which has helped them pay off some bills and save for a larger home.</p>
<p>Gambling legalization has definitely made their marriage stronger. They now have something that they both enjoy doing together and it’s brought them closer as a couple. They would definitely recommend it to other couples who are looking for ways to bond and have some fun together.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Credits-Gambling-for-Stopping-their-Worrying"><a href="#Couple-Credits-Gambling-for-Stopping-their-Worrying" class="headerlink" title="Couple Credits Gambling for Stopping their Worrying"></a>Couple Credits Gambling for Stopping their Worrying</h1><p>A new study has found that a certain number of couples have started gambling as a way to stop worrying about their relationship. The research, which is set to be published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, surveyed more than 500 people in relationships where one partner gambles and one doesn’t.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the non-gambling partners in these relationships were less likely to report anxiety and insecurity within the relationship. In contrast, the partners who gambled were more likely to feel positive about their relationship.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Andrew Powell-Smith, said that while gambling may not be the healthiest coping mechanism, it seems to work for some couples.</p>
<p>“Gambling can be a risky way to deal with problems in a relationship, but for some couples it seems to work,” Powell-Smith said in a statement. “Our findings suggest that there may be benefits for both partners when one person gambles and the other does not.”</p>
<p>Powell-Smith added that the findings could help professionals working with couples who struggle with anxiety and insecurity within their relationships.</p>
<h1 id="Springfield-couple-find-love-and-happiness-after-legalized-gambling"><a href="#Springfield-couple-find-love-and-happiness-after-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Springfield couple find love and happiness after legalized gambling"></a>Springfield couple find love and happiness after legalized gambling</h1><p>Gamblers in Springfield have been rejoicing since the legalization of gambling last year. The couple in town, however, have found something even more valuable than money – they’ve found love.</p>
<p>When the state passed the gambling law, Gary and Karen decided to give it a try. At first it was just for fun, but soon they were both hooked on the excitement of winning and losing. They started spending more and more time at the casino and their relationship began to suffer. They would argue about money and who was going to stay home with the kids.</p>
<p>But then something amazing happened – they started winning. Not big sums of money, but enough to make them happy. They started going out again and enjoying each other’s company. Now they can’t imagine life without gambling and are planning on taking a trip to Las Vegas to try their luck there.</p>
<p>Gambling has brought this couple back together and made them happier than they ever were before. Isn’t that what love is all about?</p>
<h1 id="How-my-partner-and-I-learned-to-stop-worrying-together-with-love-legalized-gambling"><a href="#How-my-partner-and-I-learned-to-stop-worrying-together-with-love-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How my partner and I learned to stop worrying together with love legalized gambling"></a>How my partner and I learned to stop worrying together with love legalized gambling</h1><p>My partner and I recently legalized gambling in our state and we could not be happier. We have always loved gambling together, but were worried that it was not legal in our state. Now that it is legal, we can enjoy spending time together gambling in the comfort of our own home.</p>
<p>There are so many different types of gambling to choose from and we have tried them all. We love playing the slots and trying to hit the jackpot. My partner loves poker and I love blackjack. We also enjoy playing online casino games together. We find that we can really relax and forget about the outside world when we are gambling together.</p>
<p>The great thing about legalized gambling is that it is a great way to bring people together. There is nothing like sharing a victory or a loss with someone you love. We have made some great friends at the casino and we enjoy hanging out with them when we can.</p>
<p>We highly recommend legalizing gambling in your state. It can really enhance your relationship with your partner and bring you closer together.</p>

However, by following a few simple tips and tricks from the pros, you can definitely give yourself the best chance possible!</p>
<p>Tip 1: Choose the Right Slot Machine</p>
<p>Not all slot machines are created equal. Some offer better payout percentages than others. So, when choosing which machine to play, do your research first. Check out the pay tables to see where the most money can be won.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Bet Max</p>
<p>When playing slots, always bet the maximum amount allowed. This will increase your chances of winning by ensuring that you are playing all of the available lines.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Use Your Bonus Money Wisely</p>
<p>Many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players. When cashing in your bonus money, make sure you bet it on high paying slots games. This will maximize your chances of winning while using free money!</p>
<p>Tip 4: Practice Before Playing for Real Money</p>
<p>If you’re not yet comfortable with playing slots, practice first by playing for free in demo mode. This way you can learn the ropes and get a feel for how different machines work before risking any real money.</p>
<h1 id="Amazing-Winning-Strategies-for-Slot-Games-that-Will-Help-You-Take-Home-the-Jackpot"><a href="#Amazing-Winning-Strategies-for-Slot-Games-that-Will-Help-You-Take-Home-the-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Amazing Winning Strategies for Slot Games that Will Help You Take Home the Jackpot!"></a>Amazing Winning Strategies for Slot Games that Will Help You Take Home the Jackpot!</h1><p>There’s no doubt about it – slot games are some of the most popular casino games around.

If you’re looking to up your game and improve your chances of winning at slots, then read on for some amazing tips!</p>
<p>#1: Choose the Right Slot Game</p>
<p>Not all slot games are created equal! Some offer better odds than others, so it’s important to do your research before you start playing. Look for games that have high RTP (return to player) rates, as these will give you the best chance of winning.</p>
<p>#2: Play Maximum Lines</p>
<p>Most slot games allow players to bet on multiple lines at once. Always bet on all the lines available to you in order to maximise your chances of winning.</p>
<p>#3: Bet Max/Minimum Amounts</p>
<p>In order to win the biggest jackpots, it’s important to bet max amounts whenever possible. However, if you’re not comfortable betting large sums of money, then always bet the minimum amount allowed in order to still increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>#4: Use Slot Strategies and Tips</p>
<p>There are a number of helpful tips and strategies that can improve your chances of winning at slots. Be sure to do your research and learn as much as you can about how to play these games before hitting the casino floor!</p>
<p>Some great slot strategies include things such as: </p>
<p>– Always playing the maximum amount of coins/lines available<br>– Keeping a close eye on payout ratios and choosing games with favourable odds<br>– Knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em – i.e., knowing when it’s time to quit while you’re ahead </p>
<p>#5: Know Your Limits<br>Like with any other form of gambling, it’s important to set yourself limits before you start playing slot games. Make sure you know how much money you can afford to lose before sitting down at a machine, and stick to those limits!</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Slots-Casino-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Winning-More-Often"><a href="#Playing-Slots-Casino-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Winning-More-Often" class="headerlink" title="Playing Slots Casino: The Ultimate Guide to Winning More Often!"></a>Playing Slots Casino: The Ultimate Guide to Winning More Often!</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games and offer some of the best odds for players. While you may not be able to control whether or not you win, there are a number of things you can do to improve your chances and increase your potential payouts when playing slots casino games.</p>
<p>In order to boost your chances of winning when playing slots casino games, heed the following tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose reputable online casinos that have good track records – Not all online casinos are created equal, so it’s important to do your research before signing up with any particular site. Look for casinos that have been in business for a while, have a good reputation, and offer fair and reasonable odds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you understand the rules – Each type of slot game offers different rules, so be sure to read up on the specifics of each game before playing. For example, some games require players to bet on all paylines in order to qualify for a payout, while others allow players to bet on as few as one line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet MAX – This may seem like an obvious piece of advice, but many players make the mistake of betting too little. When playing slots casino games, always bet the maximum amount possible in order to maximize your chances of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use bonuses wisely – Most online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players, which can be a great way to get started at a new site. However, be sure to read the terms and conditions associated with these bonuses carefully, as some require you to meet certain wagering requirements before you can cash out any winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play Strategically – Slot machines are essentially just random number generators, so there’s no real strategy that can guarantee success. However, by picking games that have lower jackpots and betting more when you have a good hand, you can increase your overall chances of winning.<br>The bottom line is this: if you want to increase your chances of winning when playing slots casino games, remember these five tips!</p>

<h1 id="Secrets-of-the-Slots-Casino-Masters-Finally-Revealed"><a href="#Secrets-of-the-Slots-Casino-Masters-Finally-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Secrets of the Slots Casino Masters Finally Revealed!"></a>Secrets of the Slots Casino Masters Finally Revealed!</h1><p>The slots casino industry is one of the most lucrative and renowned ones in the world. Countless people flock to these establishments every day in the hopes of winning big, but what exactly goes on behind the scenes in order for casinos to make so much money?</p>
<h1 id="The-Business-of-Slots-Casino"><a href="#The-Business-of-Slots-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Business of Slots Casino"></a>The Business of Slots Casino</h1><p>Like any other business, slots casino establishments have to generate a profit in order to remain afloat. This usually comes from two sources: player losses and manufacturer’s commissions. When someone plays a slot machine, the casino takes a cut of each bet as well as the amount that is won. So, even if a player only bets $0.01 per spin, the casino will still take a percentage of that amount. In addition, many manufacturers require casinos to pay out a minimum percentage on each machine, regardless of whether or not it has been played. This guarantees that casinos will always make money on each machine, even when they aren’t being used.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Mechanics"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Mechanics"></a>Slot Machine Mechanics</h1><p>In order for casinos to make money on each slot machine, they need people to keep playing them. This is done by implementing various mechanics into the game which are designed to entice players to continue gambling. One such mechanic is called the “house edge”. This is a mathematical advantage built into the game by the casino which ensures that over time, they will make more money than they lose. Another technique used by casinos is known as “loss rebates”. This occurs when casinos offer players free stuff (such as food or drinks) in exchange for playing at their machines. Finally, there are also schemes known as “comps” which give players extra rewards (such as cash back or free rooms) based on how much they gamble. All of these mechanics are designed to keep players playing and losing money in the process!</p>
<h1 id="The-Risks-and-Rewards-of-Slots-Casino"><a href="#The-Risks-and-Rewards-of-Slots-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Risks and Rewards of Slots Casino"></a>The Risks and Rewards of Slots Casino</h1><p>Playing at slots casino can be both risky and rewarding. On one hand, you could potentially win big amounts of money if you hit the right jackpot. However, on the other hand, you could also lose a lot of money if you don’t happen to be lucky. It’s important to remember that slots casino games are essentially just gambling games and should therefore be treated as such!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Slots-Casino-for-Maximum-Winnings"><a href="#How-to-Play-Slots-Casino-for-Maximum-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Slots Casino for Maximum Winnings"></a>How to Play Slots Casino for Maximum Winnings</h1><p> Slot machines are perhaps the simplest casino game there is. Just insert your coins, pull the lever, and watch the wheels spin. Of course, if you want to maximize your winnings, you’ll need to know a few things about playing slots.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that not all slot machines are created equal. There are some machines that pays out more often than others. So, before you start playing, do some research on which machines payout the best.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is your bankroll. Make sure you have enough money to last you through a few rounds of play. And remember, it’s always better to start out small and work your way up as you gain experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to playing slots, there are a few basic strategies that you can use to increase your chances of winning. One strategy is to vary your bets. If you continually bet the same amount on each spin, you’re less likely to win anything significant. By spreading your bets out over several spins, you’re more likely to come out ahead in the end.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to only play slots when the machine is hot. This means that the machine has been paying out recently and is likely to do so again soon. If you wait until the machine has gone cold, there’s a good chance that you’ll end up losing money.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to have fun!Slot machines are meant to be enjoyed, so don’t get too stressed out if things don’t go your way. Just take a break and come back later when you’re feeling lucky</p>
