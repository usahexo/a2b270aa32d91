        <h1 id="Cubs-fall-to-Reds-as-small-bettors-clean-up-at-the-window"><a href="#Cubs-fall-to-Reds-as-small-bettors-clean-up-at-the-window" class="headerlink" title="Cubs fall to Reds as small bettors clean up at the window"></a>Cubs fall to Reds as small bettors clean up at the window</h1><p>The Cubs were smoked by the Reds on Monday night, as small bettors cleaned up at the betting window. The game was heavily favored in favor of the Cubs, but they failed to cover the spread, losing 6-2.</p>
<p>The Cubs were a -182 favorite in the game, but they failed to cover the spread. Bettors who backed the Reds were rewarded with a good payout, as they won outright at +157.</p>
<p>This game was a crushing loss for the Cubs and their fans. They are now two games behind the Brewers in the National League Central Division race and need to turn things around quickly if they want to make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Reds have been playing much better lately, and this win is certainly a boost for their morale. They are now just four games out of first place in the NL Central Division.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how both of these teams fare in the coming weeks. The Cubs still have a great team and should be able to make a run at the playoffs, but they definitely need to start playing better soon. The Reds are starting to look like a serious threat in the NL Central Division and could very well make a playoff run themselves.</p>
<h1 id="Brewers-stay-hot-beat-Cardinals-as-wise-guys-fade"><a href="#Brewers-stay-hot-beat-Cardinals-as-wise-guys-fade" class="headerlink" title="Brewers stay hot, beat Cardinals as wise guys fade"></a>Brewers stay hot, beat Cardinals as wise guys fade</h1><p>The Milwaukee Brewers continue to pile up wins and they are now just 1.5 games out of first place in the NL Central. The Brewers beat the Cardinals on Thursday afternoon as they got a big performance from starter Junior Guerra.</p>
<p><strong>Brewers Continue Hot Streak</strong></p>
<p>The Milwaukee Brewers continued their hot streak on Thursday afternoon with a 5-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The win keeps the Brewers just 1.5 games out of first place in the NL Central, and it was another impressive performance from starter Junior Guerra. Guerra went 7 innings and allowed just 2 runs while striking out 8 batters, and he is now 4-0 on the season. This has been a great start to the year for Guerra, and he is surely making a case to be an All-Star.</p>
<p>While Guerra was impressive on Thursday, it was also a big day offensively for the Brewers. Jesus Aguilar had 3 hits including 2 home runs, and Ryan Braun also added a homer in the win. This was a nice bounce-back game for Braun, who went 0 for 4 on Wednesday night. The Brewers have been one of the most explosive teams in baseball this season, and they are starting to look like serious contenders in the NL Central.</p>
<p><strong>Cardinals Continue Slide</strong></p>
<p>While the Brewers continue to dominate, the Cardinals have been struggling lately. St. Louis has now lost 6 of their last 10 games, and they are currently in fourth place in the division. This is not what Cardinals fans were expecting at the beginning of the season, but there is still plenty of time to turn things around. One issue for St. Louis has been their starting pitching, as they have not received much production from that unit so far this year. Carlos Martinez has been especially struggling, as he is now 2-3 with a 5.06 ERA on the season. If Martinez can figure things out, then the Cardinals should be able to get back into contention in this division.</p>
<h1 id="Pirates-trying-to-stay-afloat-as-underdogs-against-divisional-rivals"><a href="#Pirates-trying-to-stay-afloat-as-underdogs-against-divisional-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Pirates trying to stay afloat as underdogs against divisional rivals"></a>Pirates trying to stay afloat as underdogs against divisional rivals</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have been one of the most surprising teams in baseball this season. They were not expected to contend for a playoff spot, but they currently sit in third place in the NL Central Division.</p>
<p>The Pirates have done this despite being underdogs against every team in their division. The Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago Cubs, and St. Louis Cardinals are all considered to be stronger teams than the Pirates.</p>
<p>However, the Pirates continue to fight and play hard every day. Their pitching staff has been surprisingly good, and their offense has been timely.</p>
<p>The Brewers are currently leading the division with a record of 44-32. The Cubs are in second place at 42-35, and the Pirates are in third place at 41-37. The Cardinals are in last place at 39-41.</p>
<p>If the Pirates can continue to play well and make a run at the division title, it would be a great story for them. They have been underdogs all season long, and they have exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if they can keep up the momentum and win the division championship.</p>
<h1 id="Small-market-teams-offer-big-value-for-bettors-this-season"><a href="#Small-market-teams-offer-big-value-for-bettors-this-season" class="headerlink" title="Small market teams offer big value for bettors this season"></a>Small market teams offer big value for bettors this season</h1><p>Believe it or not, the small market teams in the NBA this season are offering some of the best value for bettors. This is likely due to a combination of factors – teams like the Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic are struggling this year, while others like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Milwaukee Bucks are playing above expectations.</p>
<p>As a result, there are some great betting opportunities to be found on these teams. The Thunder, for example, have odds of (+165) to win the Western Conference this season at BetOnline, while the Pacers have odds of (+4000) to win the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>These may seem like longshots, but when you consider that the Thunder are currently second in the West and the Pacers are fifth in the East, they become much more attractive bets. And while there is always risk involved when betting on underdogs, the potential rewards make it well worth your time.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a little value in your NBA betting this season, don’t forget about the small market teams. They may not be as flashy as some of the bigger names in the league, but they could provide you with some big wins.</p>
<h1 id="Cubs-Brewers-and-Pirates-all-provide-good-betting-value-in-National-League-Central"><a href="#Cubs-Brewers-and-Pirates-all-provide-good-betting-value-in-National-League-Central" class="headerlink" title="Cubs, Brewers and Pirates all provide good betting value in National League Central"></a>Cubs, Brewers and Pirates all provide good betting value in National League Central</h1><p>The National League Central Division is up for grabs this year, with the Cubs, Brewers and Pirates all providing good betting value.</p>
<p>The Cubs are coming off a disappointing season, but they should be much improved this year. Their lineup is one of the best in baseball, and they have a strong rotation led by Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta.</p>
<p>The Brewers finished just two games behind the Cubs last year, and they should be even better this season. They have a young team with plenty of talent, and they added some key players in the offseason, including outfielders Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain.</p>
<p>The Pirates are coming off back-to-back playoff appearances, and they should be in contention again this year. They have a solid rotation led by Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon, and their lineup is improved with the addition of Corey Dickerson.</p>
<p>All three of these teams are worth betting on this season. The Cubs are likely to win the division, but the Brewers and Pirates both provide good value as long as you don’t mind them playing in a tough division.</p>
