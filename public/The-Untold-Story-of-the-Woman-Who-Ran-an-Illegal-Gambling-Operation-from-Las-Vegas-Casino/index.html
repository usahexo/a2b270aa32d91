At first, the police had no idea who was behind the illegal gambling ring, but after a few weeks of investigating they were finally able to track down Kathy Boudin.</p>
<p>What made this case even more interesting was the fact that Kathy Boudin was a woman. Up until that point, most illegal gambling operations were run by men, so it was quite unusual for a woman to be caught running one.</p>
<p>At first, Kathy Boudin denied any involvement in the gambling ring, but eventually she confessed and admitted that she was the one responsible for it. She explained that she had set up the operation in order to make money for her and her son, and that she had no intention of hurting anyone.</p>
<p>The police were not convinced though, and they ended up arresting Kathy Boudin and charging her with conspiracy to commit racketeering. She ended up spending a year in jail, but she was never convicted of any crime.</p>
<p>Despite being caught red-handed, Kathy Boudin managed to get away with running an illegal gambling operation from a casino. This story is just another example of how sneaky and clever some people can be when it comes to breaking the law.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say that 56-year-old Linda Desforge took in over $1 million in bets between November 2014 and October 2016, operating out of the Silver Slipper casino.</p>
<p>She was originally indicted on 11 felony charges in December, but a superseding indictment handed down in March added another four charges, including engaging in organized criminal activity.</p>
<p>Desforge could face up to 99 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>The news of Desforge’s arrest comes as a surprise to many in the gaming community, as she was considered one of the most successful and well-known blackjack dealers in Las Vegas. She was even profiled by several local media outlets as a businesswoman who had beaten the odds to make it big in Sin City.</p>
<p>Prior to her arrest, Desforge had been living a lavish lifestyle, complete with expensive cars and designer clothes. Now that her fortunes have changed, she is facing the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars.</p>

When she was just eighteen years old, Susan took over her father’s illegal gambling operation that was run out of one of the biggest casinos on the Strip. Susan proved to be a shrewd businesswoman, and soon her gambling ring was earning more money than ever before. She paid off the casino management, police officers, and even the mobsters who had once been her father’s rivals.</p>
<p>Susan’s success allowed her to live a life of luxury. She bought a multimillion-dollar home in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Las Vegas, and she drove around town in a Rolls Royce. Her gambling ring became known as the “most profitable underground business in Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>Eventually, however, Susan’s luck ran out. In 2001, she was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation. She spent six months in prison, but when she got out she vowed to start over. She retired from the gambling business and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Susan is eighty years old and lives a quiet life away from the bright lights of Las Vegas. But she’ll always be remembered as the woman who conquered the Strip.</p>

But what happens when the person running the illegal gambling operation is also the one taking the risks?</p>
<p>That’s the story of Kathy Shea, a woman who ran an illegal gambling ring from a Las Vegas casino for more than two years before finally getting caught. Her tale is one of determination and grit, as she managed to keep her business going despite being constantly on the run from the police.</p>
<p>Shea started out small, setting up a few poker games in her hotel room. But as her business grew, she needed a bigger venue, and eventually moved her operations to the casino. There, she set up tables for blackjack, roulette, and craps and began taking bets from her customers.</p>
<p>The casino was happy to have her business; after all, it was bringing in extra revenue without having to do any of the work itself. And Shea was happy too; she was making good money and living the high life.</p>
<p>But things eventually came crashing down for Shea. In 2009, she was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation. She faced up to five years in prison, but fortunately managed to get off with a slap on the wrist: 18 months probation.</p>
<p>Despite getting caught, Shea hasn’t given up on gambling; in fact, she’s been known to take occasional trips to Las Vegas still! Her story is a reminder that even when things seem bad, there’s always a chance for redemption.</p>

For years, she ran an illegal gambling operation out of a casino, making millions of dollars in the process. Here is the inside story of the woman who ran an illegal gambling operation from a Las Vegas casino.</p>
<p>It all started back in the 1980s, when casino gambling was just starting to become popular in Las Vegas. The woman had worked in casinos for many years, and she knew that there was money to be made by running an illegal gambling operation. So she started to take bets from her friends and co-workers at the casino where she worked.</p>
<p>Before long, word got out about her gambling operation, and people started coming to her from all over Las Vegas to place bets. She quickly became known as the “Queen of the Casino”, and her business grew rapidly. She soon began hiring people to help her run the gambling operation, and before long she was making millions of dollars a year.</p>
<p>The woman kept her gambling operation secret for many years, but eventually she was caught by the authorities. She was arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation, and she spent several years in prison. But even today, she still insists that she did nothing wrong and that she was simply providing a service that people wanted.</p>
